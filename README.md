# EgyptianVaccineTrackingSystem
What is meant by Egyptian is that it should be specifically tailored to tracking the vaccination process for
Egyptians in Egypt in the sense that the National IDs should be 13 numbers, the user can only enter Egyptian
governorates, etc
To make things easier, we won’t account for Egyptians living abroad or non-Egyptian residents. Only
Egyptian residents.
